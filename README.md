# LiftingLog

An android app written in React Native to log lifting progress for power lifters.
You can log your highest weight and repetitions for a given date.
The app will calculate your one rep maximum and your strength score for this lift.


## Use Cases
I want to...
* know how much weight i used a given exercise the last time
* see how my lifting strength progressed over several training sessions
* see my 1RM progress over several weeks

# Goal

The project had two main goals:
* to serve as a training project to get used to React Native
* to create a better way to log my lifting progress

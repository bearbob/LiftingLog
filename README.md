<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An android app written in React Native to log lifting progress for power lifters. Log your highest weight and repetitions for a given date and the app will calculate your one rep maximum and strength scores.

There are many other tracking apps available. Therefore, the focus of this app is not to track your whole training, but only the heavy lifts. With this data, it calculates your current 1RM and lifting strength and displays progress graphs for them.

The tracker was developed with these use cases in mind:
* I want to know how much weight I used a given exercise the last time
* I want see how my lifting strength progressed over several training sessions
* I want see my 1RM progress over several weeks

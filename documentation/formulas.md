1RM = weight * (1 + (reps/30)) for r > 1

# Calculating Wilks Score

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilks_Coefficient

wilks = 500/(a + b*x + c*x^2 + d*x^3 + e*x^4 + f*x^5)

with x = Bodyweight. The values for a, b, c, d, e and f differ for men and women:
Values for men:
* a = −216.0475144
* b = 16.2606339
* c = −0.002388645
* d = −0.00113732
* e = 7.01863E−06
* f = −1.291E−08

Values for women are:
* a = 594.31747775582
* b = −27.23842536447
* c = 0.82112226871
* d = −0.00930733913
* e = 4.731582E−05
* f = −9.054E−08
